This is re-implemented DeepSRGR instantiated on ERAN
========

DeepSRGR was proposed in [TACAS'21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07722).
This repo is the re-implementaion of the spurious region guided refinement method proposed in DeepSRGR and is instantiated on DeepPoly domain in ETH Robustness Analyzer for Neural Networks ([ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran)).
